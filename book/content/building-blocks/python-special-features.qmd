## Conditional expressions {#sec-ce}

Python has 3 specials concepts related to conditional expressions.

- **truthy/falsy**: object's associated truth value
- **execution context**: decides evaluation result
- **short circuit**

All 3 concepts can be combined and used in interesting ways which allow some newer cleaner code styles for some common situations that occur while coding.

### Truthy and Falsy

- Every object in Python has an **associated truth value**
  - referred to as **object's truth value**
  - if the **object's truth value** is `True` $\implies$ **truthy**
  - if the **object's truth value** is `False` $\implies$ **falsy**
  - hence the object is **truthy** or **falsy**

- Below cases are **falsy** and everything else **truthy**:
  - `None`
  - `False`
  - `0` in any numeric type (e.g. 0, 0.0, 0+0j, â€¦)
  - `len(c) = 0`: **empty collections**
  - custom classes that implement `__bool__` or `__len__` method that return `False` or `0`

- `bool(any_object)` function returns **object's truth value**

#### Examples

##### Numeric type

```{python}
num_1_1 = 1; num_1_2 = 1.0
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| results: 'hold'

print(f'{num_1_1 = :3},\t{bool(num_1_1) = },\t{type(num_1_1) = }')
print(f'{num_1_2 = :3},\t{bool(num_1_2) = },\t{type(num_1_2) = }')
```

```{python}
num_2_1 = 0; num_2_2 = 0.0
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| results: 'hold'

print(f'{num_2_1 = :3},\t{bool(num_2_1) = },\t{type(num_2_1) = }')
print(f'{num_2_2 = :3},\t{bool(num_2_2) = },\t{type(num_2_2) = }')
```

##### Collections

```{python}
empty_string = ""; empty_tuple = (); empty_list = []; empty_dict = {}
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| results: 'hold'

print(f'{bool(empty_string) = }, {bool(empty_tuple) = }')
print(f'{bool(empty_list) = }, {bool(empty_dict) = }')
```

```{python}
non_empty_string = "abc"; non_empty_tuple = (1, 2)

non_empty_list = ["a", 1]; non_empty_dict = {"key 1": empty_list}
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| results: 'hold'
print(f'{bool(non_empty_string) = }, {bool(non_empty_tuple) = }')
print(f'{bool(non_empty_list) = }, {bool(non_empty_dict) = }')
```

### Short circuit

Short circuit is general optimization strategy used by many languages. Main idea is to avoid evaluating unnecessary condition in an boolean combination.

For example in `and` combination if first condition is false then there is no point checking the second condition. Therefore, second condition of the combination is not evaluated.

Similarly for `or` combination if the first condition is `true` then the expression is `true` in both possible cases, therefore second condition is not evaluated.

### Execution context

Python treats conditional expressions differently based on where they are used.

Boolean combinations used in conditional expression, can contain objects directly rather than comparisons. Object's truth value (`bool(<object>)`) is used rather than object itself.

#### `if`/`elif` conditions

Conditional expression used in `if`/`elif` statement's condition return booleans values (`True`/`False`).

Condition can contain object's as well, `bool(object)` is used rather than object's value.

In below code, since `x` is an empty list it is falsy, `bool(x) = False`, therefore `else` block is executed.

```{python}
x = []
if x:
    print("x is truthy")
else:
    print("x is falsy")
```

In below code, since `x` is a string, it is truthy (`bool(x) = True`), therefore `if` block is executed.

```{python}
x = "abcd"
if x:
    print("x is truthy")
else:
    print("x is falsy")
```

In below example, since `bool(x) = False`, `else` block is executed without evaluating `bool(y)`.

```{python}
x = []; y = None
if x and y:
    print("x and y returned True")
else:
    print("x was false, therefore y was not evaluated")
```

#### Outside `if`/`elif` condition

If a boolean combination is used outside `if` statement and contains objects rather than comparison, then the underlying object's value is returned, it may or may not be boolean data type.

Below regular comparisons are used outside `if` block and they are treated as usual, returning boolean values (`True`/`False`).

```{python}
x = []; y = 2
y < 5; y == 2
```

Since boolean combination is used outside `if`/`elif` statement, `bool(x)` is checked and found to be falsy, using short circuit for `and`, x is returned and y is not evaluated.

```{python}
x = []; y = 2
x and y
```

Since boolean combination is used outside `if`/`elif` statement, `bool(x)` is checked and found to be falsy, using short circuit for `or`, y is evaluated and returned.

```{python}
x = []; y = 2
x or y
```

### Summary

Tables below summarize the scenarios, where `0` and `1` signify boolean `True` and `False`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
#| cache: false

table_file_path <- "resources/tables/pybcb-tables.xlsx"
sheet <- "bool-tbl" # name or number
package <- "pander" # hux, pander, kable

tbl_df <- readxl::read_excel(here::here(table_file_path), sheet=sheet)

tbl_df <- tbl_df[c(1,2,3,4)]

tbl_out <- create_table(tbl_df, package = package)

print_tbl_out(tbl_out, package)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
#| cache: false

table_file_path <- "resources/tables/pybcb-tables.xlsx"
sheet <- "bool-tbl" # name or number
caption <- NULL
package <- "pander" # hux, pander, kable

tbl_df <- readxl::read_excel(here::here(table_file_path), sheet=sheet)

tbl_df <- tbl_df[c(1,2,5,6)]

tbl_out <- create_table(tbl_df, package = package)

print_tbl_out(tbl_out, package)
```

For `x and y`, where `x` and `y` can be variables, objects or conditions:

- evaluate `bool(x)`
    - if `bool(x)` is `True`
        - if  `x and y` is part of a condition in `if`/`elif` block
            - evaluate and return`bool(y)`
        - if `x and y` is not part of a condition in `if`/`elif` block
            - return `y`
    - if `bool(x)` is `False`
        - if  `x and y` is part of a condition in `if`/`elif` block
            - return `False`
        - if `x and y` is not part of a condition in `if`/`elif` block
            - return `x`

Similarly, for `x or y`, where `x` and `y` can be variables, objects or conditions:

- evaluate `bool(x)`
    - if `bool(x)` is `True`
        - if  `x and y` is part of a condition in `if`/`elif` block
            - return `True`
        - if `x and y` is not part of a condition in `if`/`elif` block
            - return `x`
    - if `bool(x)` is `False`
        - if  `x and y` is part of a condition in `if`/`elif` block
            - evaluate and return`bool(y)`
        - if `x and y` is not part of a condition in `if`/`elif` block
            - return `y`

### Use cases {#sec-ce-use}

#### Iterables

It is common situation where state of an iterable is not known in advance.

For example a list generated by some operation which can result in `None` or empty list or a list with values. There are some operations to be done only if the list is truthy.

Using the 3 concepts the code can be simplified as below. Both the condition are to ensure that the object is truthy.

Note that `len(some_itr) > 0` is used as second condition in `and` combination. Due to short circuit it is not evaluated if first condition is `False`, i.e. `some_itr` is `None`. If it is used as first condition, it is evaluated always, therefore will give error when the iterable is `None`.

::::: {layout="[[49,-2,49]]"}

```python
some_itr =  # some iterable object
if some_itr is not None and len(some_itr) > 0:
    # code block
else:
    # code block
```

```python
some_itr =  # some iterable object
if some_itr:
    # code block
else:
    # code block
```

:::::

#### Assign default

Another common situation is to assign a default value in case the expected value is falsy.

Below form of assignment will work. If `expected_var` is **truthy**, because of short circuit `or`, it will be returned and assigned to `new_var`. If it is **falsy**, default object will be evaluated and returned.

```python
new_var = expected_var or default_object
```

## Comprehensions

Comprehensions are a newer feature in Python which combine the fundamentals of map and filter in a more concise syntax.

They are relevant for iterables, i.e. tuples, lists, sets and dictionaries. Mostly they are used with lists and dictionaries.

Generic idea is 

- [transformation]{color="blue"} [iteration]{color="purple"} [filter]{color="red"} or
- [expression]{color="blue"} [loop]{color="purple"} [condition]{color="red"}

i.e. map expression to each item in iterable which satisfy the filter.

- Filter/condition is optional
- Comprehensions can be nested

### List comprehensions

For list comprehension generic syntax is 

- [[expression using item]{color="blue"} [for item in list]{color="purple"} [if condition on item]{color="red"}]


- example without filter: _list of squares from a list of integers_

```{python}
some_itr = list(range(10))
squared_itr = [item**2 for item in some_itr]
print(some_itr, squared_itr, sep="\n")
```

![](../../../resources/diagrams/special-features/list-comp-1.png){width="70%" fig-align="center"}

- example with filter: _list of squares from a list of integers if integer is even_

```{python}
some_itr = tuple(range(10))
evens_squared_itr = [item**2 for item in some_itr if item % 2 == 0]
print(some_itr, evens_squared_itr, sep="\n")
```

![](../../../resources/diagrams/special-features/list-comp-2.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

- example with multiple iterables: list of sum of squares of 2 iterables of numbers

```{python}
t_1 = (*range(1,4),); t_2 = (*range(4,7),)
sum_of_sqrs = [x**2 + y**2 for x, y in zip(t_1, t_2)]
t_1, t_2, sum_of_sqrs
```

- example of nested comprehensions: make all possible combinations of letters of 2 strings if they are not equal

```{python}
string_1 = 'abc'; string_2 = 'axy'
combinations = [l1 + l2 for l1 in string_1 for l2 in string_2 if l1 != l2]
print(combinations)
```

For better code readability, this can be written as

```{python}
string_1 = 'abc'; string_2 = 'axy'
combinations = [l1 + l2 
                for l1 in string_1
                    for l2 in string_2
                        if l1 != l2]
print(combinations)
```

This is same as 

```{python}
string_1 = 'abc'; string_2 = 'axy'
combinations = []
for l1 in string_1:
    for l2 in string_2:
        if l1 != l2:
            combinations.append(l1 + l2)
print(combinations)
```

### Tuple, set, dict

To return a tuple instead of a list from a comprehension use tuple constructor instead of square brackets.

For sets and dictionary just use curly braces instead of square brackets.

- example with multiple iterables: tuple of sum of squares of 2 iterables of numbers

```{python}
t_1 = (*range(1,4),); t_2 = (*range(4,7),)
sum_of_sqrs = tuple(x**2 + y**2 for x, y in zip(t_1, t_2))
t_1, t_2, sum_of_sqrs
```

- example with set

```{python}
some_set = set((1, 2, 3))
print({e**2 for e in some_set if e > 1})
```

- example with dictionary

```{python}
import string
dict_1 = dict(zip(string.ascii_letters[0:10], list(range(10))))
print(dict_1)
```

```{python}
#| results: 'hold'
dict_2 = {k: v**2 for k, v in dict_1.items() if k in {'a', 'e', 'i'}}
print(type(dict_2))
print(dict_2)
```
